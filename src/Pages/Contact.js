          <p className="whoIAm">
            Hi, my name is Libi Zak and{" "}
            <span>I am a 2D and 3D artist and animator</span> currently studying
            at the Bezalel Academy of Arts and Design in Jerusalem. I was born
            in Russia, but I have studied and worked in Israel and recently
            relocated to Syracuse NY. Throughout my studies, I have gained a
            strong foundation in various techniques and software programs used
            in cinematic arts, 3D and 2D animation. I am particularly interested
            in storytelling, developing art for unique projects, and bringing
            characters to life. I am always looking for new opportunities to
            grow and develop as an artist, and I am excited to see where my
            career will take me in the future. <span>My projects include</span>{" "}
            freelance animation for academic content, participation in a
            documentary feature film as a 2D animator, a variety of personal
            short animation films, and other projects. Thank you for visiting my
            portfolio website. I hope you enjoy viewing my work as much as I
            enjoyed creating it.
